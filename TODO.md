# TO DO LIST:
------------------
- make another prompt that gives more options for adjusting the interval, day/minute, to date, and from dates
- add functionality with cryptos using some crypto API 
- add a trading bot that follows the MACD indicator and buys when the MA crosses above the signal line and uses volume analysis to decide if and how   
  much to sell on the downward divergence. I'll have to experiment on which interval to use (1 day, 12 hour, or 6 hour)


DONE 
- add more indicator charts
- option and function of saving the graphs to a pdf
